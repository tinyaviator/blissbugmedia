    <h2>Website Created and Live</h2>
    <p>On April 1st of 2025, this website was made by tinyaviator for Blissbug. It is in v1.0 and is available on Github.</p>

    <h2>Website 1.1.1</h2>
    <p>On April 2nd of 2025, this website had a minor update and a patch on some bugs. It's basically just the start of the base updates on the site. Most simple stuff like this will be on Github from now on.</p>

    <h2 class="important">1000 Followers on Twitch</h2>
    <p class="important">On April 2nd of 2025, the Twitch account, "blissbug", achieved 1000 followers! This is an awesome goal that is only the start in Blissbug's timeline!</p>

    <h2>Website 2.0.0</h2>
    <p>The website got a new page implemented and a patch was done. Do not ignore the goal above this, it is much more important than this dev log!</p>

    <h2>Website 2.1.1</h2>
    <p>I'm still working on this website. I fixed the art pages, changed some of the code, and changed the style to work with the new code. You'll primarily notice that the logos at the home page now become more transparent when you hold your mouse over them, rather than just switching to another image.</p>
